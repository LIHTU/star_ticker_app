# Star Ticker

## Description
This app allows the user to discover new stars and track their personal sightings by simply checking them off of a list.  I hope to gamify it a little by grouping stars into Challenges (close, far, barely visible, mentioned in Star Trek, etc.).  Users will be able to share completed challenges to facebook.

### Invitation
I usually work alone would happily welcome inspired collaborators.  Please contact me if you want to collaborate and fork it and go it alone to your heart's content!
